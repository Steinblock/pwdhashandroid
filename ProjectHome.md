Based on the original implementation (http://crypto.stanford.edu/PwdHash/) but mostly on "PwdHash Sharp" by Scott Wegner (https://launchpad.net/pwdhash-sharp) PwdHashAndroid provides a simple to use UI for generating PwdHashes on the android plattform.

PwdHash allows you to remember only one password and generate hashes per domain basis.
eg. the generate password for
http://mail.google.com and
https://something.google.com is always the same.

The featured download is a beta which lacks some ui-features, but it will generate the right password hashes for you.

Here's an example of a very early UI state:
