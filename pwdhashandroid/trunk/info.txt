1. Checkout from trunk

2. Import project(s):
- Start "New Android project" wizard (Toolbar)
- Application name: "pwdhashandroid"
- Choose "Create project from existing source"
- Browse to project folder and click finish

to run unit tests, import the test project:  
- Start "New Android project" wizard (Toolbar)
- Application name: "pwdhashandroid.tests"
- Choose "Create project from existing source"
- Browse to project folders subfolder "test" and click finish

3. Create avd's for the default launch configurations (or create your own launch configs) 
(from within tools folder)
android create avd -t 1 -n android-1.1-default
android create avd -t 2 -n android-1.5-default

4. Launch configurations should be created automatically, if not create your own (pretty straight forward, just default values)
